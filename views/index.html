        Norse mythology is a body of myths belonging to the North Germanic people that stems from the Old Norse religion. It is a mythology that 
        involves 9 different realms that surround the world tree, Yggdrasil. Each realm is populated by a different race: Gods, Jötnar (giants 
        and trolls), dwarves, elves, humans, and monsters. Norse mythology has many different events including the destruction and rebirth of 
        the world, known as Ragnarök.
