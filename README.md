## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is a website about the general information of three different mythologies. We chose the theme of mythologies because it was the one that we all felt most familiar with. We all suggested different mythologies, so we decided for everyone to do the mythology that they suggested. This will result in each member of the group creating a webpage based on their chosen mythology: Greek, Norse, and Native Legends.

It will contain a minor amount of information about each mythology to give users a sneak peak at the different mythologies before they view one. While there will be a navigation bar at the top of all the pages, this page will also have links to each mythology page following each of the sneak peak sections.

### Design Choices

Our color pallete consisted of #443311, #ffaa44, #ddaa77, and just a hint of css's standard lightgreen, #90ee90. These colors resemble the golden, flaky brilliance of baklava's bread with the hint of pistachio to top it off.
